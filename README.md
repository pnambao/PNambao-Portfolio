# PNambao-Portfolio
A portfolio page showcasing the work I have done as a junior web developer.

## Description 
A portfolio page is cardinal for any person that is trying to market their skills and services to potential employers.
Thus, for this activity, I was required to make a porfolio page from scratch.
The page had to be device-friendly, meaning the webpages should be able to adjust to different screen-sizes.
It had to have my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, their work, and how to contact me.
It had to have links in the navigation bar that send the user to the corresponding sections.
It had to have any applications I have doe so far, so that when links to the applications are clicked, the user is taken to the deployed applications. 

This is an example image of the page:
